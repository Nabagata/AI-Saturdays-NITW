AI Saturdays and CSEA NITW are organizing a series of Data Science sessions from November 2019 onwards. This series will go on for at least 3 months, but can extend longer as well. We will have at least two or more sessions per month throughout the series. We will be sharing and following our [open online curriculum for learning Data Science](https://github.com/nabagata/LearnDataScience/blob/master/curriculum.md), that anyone can go through.

At each session, we will have a talk from an Data Science expert from the ecosystem, and after that we'll have hours of peer learning and collaboration. Participates will pair together and work through challenges and projects, and they will also be encouraged to regularly share their progress with everyone

We will have 10-15 mentors throughout the program, who will provide guidance to the participants. And some of them will be giving the talks

And of course, it goes without saying, this will be free to participate. No participate will be charged anything.
