# Learn Data Science Schedule 
|Meetup  | Title      | Date | Description|
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
|1| **Intro to Machine Learning** | 10th December, 2019 | A Kaggle course was shared to learn the core ideas in machine learning and build your first models |
<!--|2| **Gradient Descent and related algorithms.** | 14th December, 2019 | Using the assignments that we have provided in Meetup 1, we have to explain gradient descent, and possibly the other such algorithms. The assignment for this meetup will be considering a loss function and randomly initiated the weights and plotting the loss using python.|-->
<!--|3| **Regression Techniques.** | 21st December, 2019 | We'll include Linear and Logistic Regression in this session.|-->
<!--|4| **Tree-based and Bagging Algorithms.** | 4th January, 2020 | Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc|-->
<!--|5| **Boosting Techniques.** | 18th January, 2020 | XGBoost, LightGBM, etc|-->
<!--|6| **Intro to Neural Nets.** | 1st February, 2020 | We'll start from linear and logistic regression and complicate it a little to explain Deep Neural Nets. If possible we can explain CNNs and RNNs as well.|-->
